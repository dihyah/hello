                I'm Dihyah, an aspiring web developer and computer networking engineer from a country called Brunei. A little bit about my country; Brunei is surrounded by Malaysia and Indonesia borders on the island of Borneo that is located in the heart of South-East Asia, with the likes of Singapore.
                </p>

                <p>
                I currently learn how to be a freelance full-stack web developer through whatever courses I can find. I also have a background in Information Technology as National Diploma. Where I'm from, my country adopts UK's education system. After graduating from my national diploma, I took a different direction and pursued Business Accounting as my Higher National Diploma and that has been my current highest formal academic qualification. At the time, I was fascinated with the business industry especially in client negotiation environments like in Wall Street.
                </p>

                <p>
                Unfortunately, the employment within the industry has already been saturated and employment has been quite challenging for me to be given a chance. The tech industry however, contrasts very heavily as there aren't enough workforce with the tech skills to satifyingly supply any tech related positions. Large organizations whether government or private still generally rely on outsourcing foreigners for both large and small services from server rental to web development since they can offer more outstanding result with their high tech skills.
                </p>

                <p>
                That's why I want to seize this opportunity to provide the same standard service to large, medium and small business organizations alike to look no further if they would like to have their own website without outsourcing with overcharged payments or relying on plugins with its set of limitations.
